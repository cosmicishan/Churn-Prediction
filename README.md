Predicting Customer Churn at a Fictitious Wireless Telecom Company


Churn Management has gotten great attention among the telecommunication Industry because it is proved that instead of going for advertisements to find new customers it’s better to find a technique, solution, and all the available resources in our service to figure out a pattern to make customers stay in the company. Every telecommunication company has huge competition and due to easy access of the plans and services provided by all the companies, a customer can switch the company anytime. For churn Prediction, it is most required to identify the customer who has the highest probability of leaving the service of the company and it will be effective if it’s done at the right time. Through this company can make a decision on what service to provide to make the customer not leave the service.

Here, we can reformulate the given problem as a Classification problem. Our goal is to build a Classification model that can predict if Customers will stay with the company or not from the given features. To achieve this, first, we need to do the data analysis and data cleaning, data preparation for training, and then model building. After this, based on the performance we need to find the best parameters which best suits for the given data and give the expected result.
